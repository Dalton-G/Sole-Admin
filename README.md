Sole provides admins with the ability to manage multiple stores at once, CRUD products, track orders, and more. Additionally, admins can add categories, colors and sizes to each product to appeal to the right target shoppers. It also features a beautiful dashboard with graphs to summary important store information, and the ability to toggle light/dark theme.
